## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- Dynamic page
- NodeJS
- BDD
- EJS


### What I learned

This challenge helped me use BDD to improve my front-end results. It allowed me to focus on a single, simple page with dynamic data.

Using CSS Grid was very helpful for responsive design, providing a consistent layout across mobile, tablet, and desktop versions.

### Continued development

For this project, I plan to focus on adding transition animations, particularly based on user interactions.
